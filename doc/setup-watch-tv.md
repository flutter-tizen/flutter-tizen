# Developing for watch and TV devices over Wi-Fi

In order to install and test Flutter apps on your watch or TV device, you have to first enable the connection between the device and your host machine.

1. Make sure the host and the target device are on the same network (connected to the same access point).

2. Enable the developer options.

   - For _Galaxy Watch_, open **Settings - About watch - Software** and tap **Software version** multiple times.

   - For _Smart TV_, open **Apps**, enter **12345** using the remote control or the on-screen number keypad, switch **Developer mode** to **On**, enter your host's IP address and press **OK**. You will see **Develop mode** is enabled in **Apps** after rebooting the TV.

3. Connect on your host using the device's IP address.

   ```sh
   $ sdb connect 192.168.0.101
   connecting to 192.168.0.101:26101 ...
   connected to 192.168.0.101:26101

   $ sdb devices
   List of devices attached
   192.168.0.101:26101     device          SM-R800
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- #### Connection failure

  ```sh
  $ sdb connect 192.168.0.101
  connecting to 192.168.0.101:26101 ...
  failed to connect to 192.168.0.101:26101
  ```

  Check if the target device is on the same network as the host, and the port is not blocked by a firewall. For _Smart TV_, make sure you entered the host IP address correctly in the developer mode settings.

- #### Device unauthorized

  ```sh
  $ sdb devices
  List of devices attached
  192.168.0.101:26101     unauthorized    <unknown>
  ```

  Check the confirmation dialog on the device and approve the connection.

# AI rules for Flutter-Tizen
This guide covers how you can leverage AI rules to streamline your Flutter-Tizen.

_This AI rules guide is based on [AI ​​rules for Flutter and Dart page](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/ai-rules) and [ai_rules.md](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/rules/rules.md)._

You can provide the AI-powered editor with ai_rules.md to give the LLM context and instructions. It can help you write Flutter applications for TizenOS TV and Raspberry Pi using flutter-tizen.
